Description: Provides lightweight, dependency-minimal tools for generating 
    and validating RDF N-Triples in R. Functions include IRI construction 
    and sanitization, XSD datatype conversion, literal formatting, and 
    triple assembly from data frames or lists. Designed to be reusable by 
    other packages, such as those implementing higher-level RDF data 
    models, without requiring full RDF library dependencies.
